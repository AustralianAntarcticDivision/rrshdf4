plan

need a way to calculate from bins using only an extent

give class L3 to readL3 objects

crop methods: 

 - crop(initbin, extent) ## builds the bin list within an extent
 - crop(L3, extent)  ## matches from above list
 

remove old error stuff, put in R-level tests for this

ensure NUMROWS is properly detected and isolated
